# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.12.2] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **Distribution proof runbook**: added the canonical release smoke matrix and corrected Homebrew tap flow so post-cut install verification has one current operator path.

### Changed

- Apple and iOS support surfaces now point to dated April 15, 2026 evidence instead of generic support claims, and the odrive parity backlog is refreshed against the current Linux-first product posture.

### Fixed

- **macOS release packaging**: release builds now vendor OpenSSL for macOS arm64 artifacts, and release CI fails if `tcfsd` still links a dynamic Homebrew OpenSSL dylib.
- **Sync state keying**: fixed state-key lookup after delete-through-symlink-parent cases so `remove()` and follow-up reads hit the same cached entry.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- **Named live acceptance lane**: `neo-honey` is now the canonical live SeaweedFS + NATS + two-device smoke path, with a documented script and matching e2e naming.
- **Failure-oriented validation**: added targeted coverage for manifest/index crash windows, retry backoff behavior, NATS durable replay semantics, live storage outage recovery, and CLI/gRPC/MCP/FUSE workflow paths.
- **Orphan chunk reporting and cleanup**: reconcile can now surface orphaned remote chunks and clean them up conservatively after a grace period.

### Changed

- Release workflow now signs GHCR images by immutable digest, honors explicit tags on manual proof runs, and no longer lets Apple notarization outages fail the entire release.
- Release notes and platform/docs surfaces now describe Apple notarization as attempted rather than guaranteed, and keep Apple packaging positioned as experimental.

### Fixed

- **Crash-safe rel-path publish**: manifest/index publication now uses recovery-aware staged, preparing, and committed index states with deterministic crash-window recovery.
- **Upload and path correctness**: fixed upload TOCTOU races, Unicode rel-path normalization, gRPC push path traversal rejection, manifest-read retries, and resumable key rotation.
- **State and lifecycle correctness**: fixed StateCache metadata persistence, PathLocks cleanup under contention, orphan cleanup wiring, and rename/delete sync lifecycle handling across CLI and FUSE flows.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added

- **Finder status surfaces**: macOS FileProvider gained Finder Sync badge support, download progress reporting, and policy-aware excluded or pinned status badges.
- **Conflict UX improvements**: conflict notifications, conflict-copy remote writes, and CLI policy controls for handling sync conflicts.
- **Apple packaging updates**: release artifacts include notarized Apple Silicon `.pkg` installers and bundled `TCFSProvider.app` payloads.

### Changed

- macOS release builds now vendor OpenSSL to avoid code-signing and runtime loader failures during packaging.
- Canonical release assets now ship from `Jesssullivan/tummycrypt` with GitHub Releases, GHCR images, Homebrew tap updates, and Nix cache publication.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-04-08

### Added

- **`tcfs reconcile` CLI**: explicit reconcile command wired to the bidirectional plan-and-execute sync engine introduced in `0.10.0`.
- **Scheduler safety wiring**: `PathLocks` and `FileSyncStatus` now drive daemon scheduling decisions instead of remaining library-only primitives.
- **Watcher blacklist enforcement**: daemon watcher-to-scheduler flow now applies the shared blacklist logic consistently.
- CI step for the sync integration path to exercise the new robustness and reconciliation lanes during automation.

### Changed

- Release pipeline hardening for container build and publish flow, including lowercase GHCR naming fixes.
- Re-enabled Attic cache use in the Nix fleet configuration after the earlier stale-cache disablement.
- FileProvider build script now validates outputs and required configuration before packaging.

### Fixed

- Removed plaintext credential handling from repo and deployment surfaces.
- Documentation refreshed to match the active development state after the `0.10.x` sync-safety push.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- **Read-write FUSE/VFS path**: write, create, unlink, mkdir, rename, and rmdir operations now flow through the SeaweedFS-backed mount path.
- **FUSE write pipeline parity**: FastCDC chunking, transparent `.tc` handling, NATS publish on write, and index-first auto-pull wiring for mounted file edits.
- **Encryption wiring across push paths**: `EncryptionContext` and encrypted manifest support now cover the remaining CLI and daemon upload paths.
- **Daemon self-sufficiency**: daemon startup can provision sockets, local directories, credentials, and unlock flow without external bootstrapping.
- **iOS/FileProvider onboarding work**: QR enrollment improvements, credential-broker support, build-info surfaces, and several FileProvider fixes landed in the Apple lane.

### Changed

- FUSE3 returned as the default mount backend, with the NFS path retained as fallback.
- Stale Attic cache configuration was disabled in Nix surfaces while binary-cache behavior was being corrected.

### Fixed

- Cross-host sync lookup and pull behavior now normalize `rel_path`, repair absolute-path push fallout, and add fallback filename search where older index state exists.
- FUSE hydration now understands JSON v2 manifests and decrypts encrypted chunks with the correct file identity.
- Watcher, daemon, and NATS paths now avoid skipped-upload orphaned index entries and missing prefix propagation.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- **Centralized blacklist** (`tcfs-sync::blacklist`): Consolidates 6 scattered exclusion sites (watcher, engine, VFS, git safety) into a single `Blacklist` type with `check()`, `check_name()`, and `check_path_components()` methods. Configurable glob patterns, hidden dirs, .git policy.
- **Directory reconciliation pipeline** (`tcfs-sync::reconcile`): Plan-then-execute bidirectional sync. `reconcile()` diffs local tree vs remote index producing a `ReconcilePlan` (pure data). `execute_plan()` performs I/O via existing engine primitives. Supports push, pull, delete, conflict detection via vector clocks.
- **Per-folder sync policies** (`tcfs-sync::policy`): `PolicyStore` with `FolderPolicy` (SyncMode, download_threshold, auto_unsync_exempt). Parent-chain walk inheritance — policy on `/project` applies to all descendants.
- **Auto-unsync controller** (`tcfs-sync::auto_unsync`): Background sweep finds files where `last_synced` exceeds configurable max age. Respects PolicyStore exemptions, skips dirty files (unsynced local changes). Removes from state cache only — local files preserved.
- **PathLocks**: Per-path async mutex preventing concurrent push/pull/unsync on the same file. RAII guard with automatic cleanup.
- **FileSyncStatus enum**: 5-state runtime status (NotSynced, Synced, Active, Locked, Conflict) for gRPC/JSON.
- **Unsync dirty-child check**: Before folder unsync, scans `children_with_prefix()` for unsynced modifications. Errors unless `force=true`.
- **Diagnostics RPC**: New gRPC endpoint reporting state cache size, conflict count, NATS seq, auto-unsync eligible count, storage health, uptime.
- **Scheduler observability**: `active()`, `completed()`, `failed()` counters on `SyncScheduler` for operational monitoring.
- `children_with_prefix()` on `StateCacheBackend` for directory-level state queries.
- `list_remote_index()` for fetching remote S3 index entries.
- `parse_index_entry()` for the `manifest_hash=.../size=.../chunks=...` format.
- Config fields: `auto_unsync_max_age_secs`, `auto_unsync_interval_secs`, `auto_unsync_dry_run`.
- CI job for `cargo test -p tcfs-sync --features nats,crypto`.

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: `auth.require_session` now defaults to `true` (was `false`). Add `auth.require_session = false` for dev environments.
- **BREAKING**: `NatsClient::connect()` now accepts `require_tls: bool` parameter. If `nats_tls=true` and URL is `nats://`, auto-upgrades to `tls://`.
- Storage `RetryLayer` now uses exponential backoff factor (2.0x) in addition to existing jitter.
- Scheduler backoff adds ±25% jitter to prevent thundering herd on retries.
- Auto-unsync interval task wired into daemon lifecycle (after session cleanup).

### Fixed

- **Credential file permissions**: TOTP credentials, WebAuthn credentials, session tokens, device registry, and state cache now enforce `chmod 0o600` on write (was umask-dependent).
- **NATS TLS enforcement**: `nats_tls` config option was defined but silently ignored. Now wired into `connect()` with URL scheme upgrade.
- CLI uses config bucket as default push prefix instead of filename.
- NATS rel_path normalization for cross-host state cache lookup.

### Security

- 5 credential write paths now enforce restrictive file permissions (`0o600`).
- NATS connections without TLS log explicit plaintext warning.
- Session authentication required by default for all gRPC calls.

### Added

- **RocksDB state cache backend**: `StateCacheBackend` trait with JSON (default) and RocksDB (behind `full` feature) implementations
- **E2E encryption in push/pull pipeline**: `EncryptionContext` wires `tcfs-crypto` into chunk upload/download when `config.crypto.enabled = true`
- **SyncManifest `encrypted_file_key`**: Base64-encoded wrapped per-file key stored in manifest for encrypted files
- **Windows CFAPI wiring**: `tcfs-cloudfilter` provider, hydration, and placeholder modules use `tcfs-sync` manifest parsing and chunk integrity verification
- **macOS FileProvider FFI**: `tcfs-file-provider` exposes C-compatible `extern "C"` functions via cbindgen for Swift consumption
- **Tailscale NATS exposure**: OpenTofu module `tailscale-nats` exposes NATS to tailnet via Tailscale operator (no public IP)
- **Darwin launchd support**: Home Manager module generates `launchd.agents.tcfsd` on macOS, `systemd.user.services.tcfsd` on Linux
- **`syncRoot` option**: Exposed in both NixOS and Home Manager modules for daemon auto-pull target directory
- **`TCFS_S3_ACCESS`/`TCFS_S3_SECRET` env vars**: tcfs-native credential env var names (highest priority in fallback chain)
- **Justfile**: IaC command surface for OpenTofu, Kubernetes, NATS, and build operations
- Encryption round-trip integration tests (`encrypted_roundtrip_test.rs`)
- RocksDB persistence tests (`rocksdb_state_test.rs`)

- **NATS auto-pull**: State sync loop now downloads remote files automatically in `auto` conflict mode, with vclock comparison and AutoResolver tie-breaking for concurrent edits
- **Hydrate RPC**: Downloads file from `.tc` stub metadata, removes stub after successful hydration
- **Unsync RPC**: Removes path from state cache without deleting remote or local data
- **Watch RPC**: Streams filesystem events (created/modified/deleted) using `notify` crate with recursive watching
- **Mount RPC**: Spawns `tcfs mount` subprocess with active mount tracking
- **Unmount RPC**: Runs `fusermount3 -u` (fallback `fusermount -u`), cleans up tracked subprocess
- `sync_root` config option: local directory root for auto-pull file downloads
- ConflictResolved NATS events published after resolution, merged by remote peers
- 10 new tests: 4 conflict resolution integration tests + 6 vclock comparison unit tests

### Changed
