//! The `VirtualFilesystem` trait — platform-agnostic filesystem operations.
//!
//! This trait abstracts the filesystem logic shared between all backends:
//! - FUSE (Linux primary mount backend, macOS legacy)
//! - NFS loopback (Linux + macOS, no kernel modules)
//! - FileProvider (macOS + iOS native)
//! - fanotify pre-content (Linux 6.14+, future)
//!
//! Implementations translate between this trait and their protocol-specific
//! wire formats (fuse3 PathFilesystem, NFSv3 RPC, NSFileProvider callbacks).
