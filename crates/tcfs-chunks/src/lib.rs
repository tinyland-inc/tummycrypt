//! tcfs-chunks: content-addressed chunking, BLAKE3 hashing, and seekable zstd compression
//!
//! # Overview
//! - `blake3`: deterministic file/slice hashing (content identity)
//! - `fastcdc`: content-defined chunking — stable boundaries even with inserts
//! - `seekable_zstd`: frame-based compression enabling random-access decompression
//! - `delta`: rsync rolling-hash delta sync (Phase 4 stub)
