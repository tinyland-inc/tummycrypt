//! Device identity management for multi-device E2E encryption.
//!
//! Each device gets its own age X25519 keypair. Device secret keys are stored in
//! the platform keychain or an owner-only age-encrypted file.
//!
//! ## Registry integrity (TIN-1417 B4)
//!
//! The *registry itself* (the list of devices, which doubles as the per-device
//! age **recipient set**) is the high-value attack surface: anyone with direct
//! object-store write access to `meta_prefix/tcfs-meta/devices.json` could inject
//! a hostile recipient, un-revoke a device, or drop a device. To make per-device
//! revocation trustworthy the registry is wrapped in an **Ed25519 signature** over
//! a canonical serialization of the device list.
//!
//! The signing key is *derived deterministically from the master key* via
//! HKDF-SHA256 (domain `tcfs-device-registry-signing-v1`), so any master-key
//! holder can sign and verify without distributing new key material. The
//! signature and the signer's Ed25519 verifying key are stored alongside the
//! device list in the same JSON object (see [`SIGNATURE_FIELD`]). Old (unsigned)
//! registries still deserialize for a bounded back-compat migration window, but
//! the recipient-set builders refuse to wrap to recipients from a registry that
//! fails verification — they fall back to the shared master wrap instead.
//!
//! `signing_key_hash` on a [`DeviceIdentity`] is a BLAKE3 self-fingerprint of the
//! device's *own* public key — it is NOT a signature and conveys no authority.
