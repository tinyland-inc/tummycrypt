//! E2E test: file modification in various sync states
//!
//! Tests that the sync engine correctly detects and handles file modifications:
//!   - Modified files are re-uploaded (not skipped)
//!   - Size changes (grow/shrink/truncate) are handled
//!   - State cache reflects final content after rapid overwrites
//!   - Device identity and vclock are preserved across modifications
//!   - State cache persists correctly across open/close cycles
