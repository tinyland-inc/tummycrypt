# Feature Parity Gap Analysis: odrive vs tummycrypt

**Date**: 2026-04-04
**Source**: Reverse engineering of `odriveagent` Linux ELF binary (Python 2.7/PyInstaller)
**Target**: tummycrypt workspace v0.9.1 (Rust, 18 crates)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

tummycrypt already possesses a fundamentally stronger architecture than odrive in several dimensions: CRDT-based conflict resolution (vector clocks vs timestamp comparison), content-defined chunking (FastCDC vs fixed-size XL splitting), FUSE-based virtual filesystem (vs placeholder file extensions that pollute the namespace), fleet-wide sync via NATS JetStream (vs single-machine polling), and modern cryptography (XChaCha20-Poly1305 with proper key hierarchy vs PyCrypto with plaintext passphrase storage).

However, odrive has ~10 years of iteration on the **sync lifecycle** -- the full expand/sync/unsync/auto-unsync pipeline, the refresh/merge eight-stage reconciliation engine, per-folder sync policies, sticky sync settings, blacklist filtering, trash management, and mature error recovery with per-provider backoff. These are the areas where tummycrypt has significant gaps to close.

The recommended path is not to replicate odrive's architecture (which is a monolithic Python 2.7 codebase with deep tech debt), but to adopt its **behavioral semantics** -- the user-facing features and sync guarantees -- while maintaining tummycrypt's superior infrastructure.

**Critical gaps** (must-have for parity): three-way merge base tracking, auto-unsync with disk pressure awareness, per-folder sync policies, blacklist/exclude filtering at the event layer, and structured refresh pipeline.

**Already superior** in tummycrypt: conflict detection (CRDTs), encryption (modern AEAD), chunking (CDC), transport (NATS), IPC (gRPC), authentication (MFA/WebAuthn), and FUSE mount (no filesystem pollution).

## 3. High-Priority Gaps to Close

These are features tummycrypt needs for production parity with odrive's sync behavior.

### 3.1 Explicit File Sync State Machine

**What odrive has**: `FileSyncState` enum with four states (NOT_SYNCED, SYNCED, ACTIVE, LOCKED) tracked per-file in `SyncTrackingTable`. Transitions are guarded and badges update on change.

**What TC needs**: A formal `SyncState` enum in `tcfs-sync` or `tcfs-core` that the daemon, FUSE layer, and CLI all reference. Current state is implicit (presence in state cache = synced, absence = not synced, no "active" or "locked" states).

**Implementation**: Add to `tcfs-sync::state`:
```rust
enum FileSyncStatus { NotSynced, Synced, Active, Locked, Conflict }
```
Store alongside `SyncState` in the state cache. The FUSE driver should query this to show appropriate behavior (e.g., return EAGAIN for ACTIVE files).

### 3.2 Per-Item Locking (`LockedItem` Equivalent)

**What odrive has**: `LockedItem` wrapper prevents concurrent operations on the same file path. Multiple folders can sync concurrently, but a single file cannot be refreshed + synced simultaneously.

**What TC needs**: A `tokio::sync::RwLock`-based path lock manager. The `SyncScheduler` currently does not check if a task's target path is already being processed.

**Implementation**: Add to `tcfs-sync::scheduler` or a new `tcfs-sync::locks` module:
```rust
struct PathLocks {
    locks: DashMap<PathBuf, Arc<RwLock<()>>>,
}
```
Acquire write lock before push/pull/unsync operations; read lock for status queries.

### 3.3 Auto-Unsync with Timestamp Aging

**What odrive has**: `AutoUnsyncController` runs a background sweep using `NodeTimestamp` column, checking `iterate_tracking_values_with_timestamp_older_than`. Files not accessed within the threshold are dehydrated to placeholders. Delivers OS notification with space saved.

**What TC needs**: A background task in `tcfsd` that:
1. Periodically scans state cache entries by `last_synced` or file atime
2. Checks if files exceed an age threshold
3. Calls the unsync path for eligible files
4. Respects a "pinned" list (equivalent of StickySyncTable)
5. Reports space reclaimed

**Implementation location**: New module `tcfsd::auto_unsync` or extend `tcfs-sync::scheduler`.

### 3.4 Per-Folder Sync Policies

**What odrive has**: Three SQL tables control per-folder behavior:
- `SyncModeTable`: sync mode per folder (always/on-demand/never/streaming)
- `StickySyncTable`: persistent per-folder settings (download threshold, expand subfolders)
- `ProSyncFolderTable`: designated always-synced folders

**What TC needs**: A policy system that maps folder paths to sync behaviors. This should be stored in the state cache (or a separate config file) and consulted by:
- The FUSE driver (should it auto-hydrate?)
- The watcher (should it auto-push changes?)
- The auto-unsync controller (should it dehydrate old files here?)

**Implementation**: Add a `PolicyStore` to `tcfs-core::config` with per-path rules:
```rust
struct FolderPolicy {
    sync_mode: SyncMode,          // Always, OnDemand, Never
    download_threshold: Option<u64>, // auto-hydrate below this size
    auto_unsync_exempt: bool,     // never auto-dehydrate
}
```

### 3.5 Blacklist/Exclude at Event Layer

**What odrive has**: `Blacklist` class applied at three points: FSEvent ingestion, RefreshChildren scan filtering, and Compare/MergeFiles filtering. Prevents `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, temp files, VCS directories from entering the sync pipeline at all.

**What TC has**: `CollectConfig.exclude_patterns` in `tcfs-sync::engine::collect_files()` (push only). The FUSE/VFS layer has no exclusion logic. The watcher ignores `.git`, `.DS_Store`, `target`, `node_modules` by name match but has no glob support.

**What TC needs**: A centralized `Blacklist` in `tcfs-core` that is consulted by:
1. `FileWatcher` (skip events for excluded paths)
2. `collect_files()` (current behavior, consolidate patterns)
3. `TcfsVfs` (skip excluded entries in readdir)

### 3.6 Structured Refresh/Reconciliation Pipeline

**What odrive has**: An eight-stage pipeline (Refresh -> RefreshChildren -> GroupByPosition -> Compare -> FileFormats -> MergeFiles -> Operations -> AddFolder) that produces a complete reconciliation plan before executing any operations.

**What TC has**: Point operations -- `upload_file`, `download_file`, `push_tree` -- that execute immediately. No directory-level reconciliation that detects remote-only, local-only, and both-modified items in a single pass.

**What TC needs**: A `Reconciler` that:
1. Lists remote index entries for a prefix
2. Walks local filesystem
3. Aligns items by path (like GroupByPosition)
4. Compares via vector clocks (like Compare)
5. Produces an operation plan (upload/download/conflict/delete)
6. Executes the plan

**Implementation**: New module `tcfs-sync::reconcile` consuming `tcfs-sync::engine` primitives.

### 3.7 Unsync Dirty-Child Safety Check

**What odrive has**: Before unsyncing a folder, `_first_item_that_cannot_unsync` iterates children, checks for modified-but-not-uploaded content (`is_content_change`), and prompts the user if dirty children are found.

**What TC has**: `Unsync` gRPC call with a `force` flag but no dirty-child check.

**What TC needs**: Before unsync, scan the subtree for files where `needs_sync()` returns `Some(reason)`. If any dirty children exist and `force` is false, return an error listing the dirty paths.

---

## 4. Lower-Priority Gaps (Nice-to-Have)

### 4.1 Throughput Monitoring and Dynamic Batch Sizing

odrive's `QueuedExpand` monitors `minThroughput` per download, dynamically reduces batch sizes when throughput drops, and delays on rate limits. TC's `SyncScheduler` has fixed `max_concurrent`. Adding adaptive concurrency based on observed throughput would improve behavior on slow or rate-limited connections.

### 4.2 OS Trash Integration

odrive offers `_sendToOsTrash` as an alternative to hard-delete during unsync and conflict resolution. TC should expose this as a configuration option, using platform trash APIs.

### 4.3 macOS Finder Badge Integration

odrive has `BadgeRefreshService` for Finder overlay icons. TC has `tcfs-file-provider` for Apple FileProvider integration which is more modern, but desktop Finder badge overlays (via Finder Sync Extension) would improve the Mac UX for non-FileProvider use cases.

### 4.4 Streaming Mode

odrive has a `StreamingController` for real-time streaming from supported providers. TC could implement this via NATS streaming consumers for live-tail of remote changes.

### 4.5 Backup Job Scheduling

odrive has `BackupJobTable` for scheduled backup definitions (source path, remote destination, settings). TC could add scheduled push jobs via the `tcfs-sync::scheduler`.

### 4.6 On-Demand Diagnostic Dump

odrive generates `DiagnosticDump`, `ThreadsDump`, `SyncActivityDump`, `ExceptionDump` on demand. TC should expose a `Diagnostics` gRPC call that dumps scheduler state, active tasks, NATS consumer lag, cache stats, and recent errors.

### 4.7 Encryption-as-Adapter Composability

odrive's `EncryptionSync9Adapter` wraps any storage adapter, making encryption transparent and composable. TC's encryption is feature-gated in the sync engine with `#[cfg(feature = "crypto")]` blocks throughout `upload_file_with_device` and `download_file_with_device`. A middleware/adapter pattern in TC's OpenDAL operator chain would be cleaner.

---

## 5. Areas Where tummycrypt Is Already Superior

### 5.1 Conflict Resolution (Vector Clocks vs Timestamps)

TC's `VectorClock` in `tcfs-sync::conflict` provides mathematically correct partial ordering of concurrent events. odrive's three-way compare uses mtime/size, which can miss conflicts when clocks are skewed or files are modified within the same second. TC's proptest suite validates CRDT properties (commutativity, associativity, idempotency, antisymmetry).

### 5.2 Content-Defined Chunking (FastCDC vs Fixed Splits)

TC uses FastCDC (`tcfs-chunks::fastcdc`) which produces stable chunk boundaries even when content is inserted or deleted. odrive's XL file splitting uses fixed-size segments, meaning a single-byte insertion shifts all subsequent chunk boundaries, causing full re-upload.

### 5.3 FUSE Mount (Virtual FS vs Placeholder Extensions)

TC's `tcfs-fuse` + `tcfs-vfs` presents cloud files as a native filesystem mount. Files appear with their real names and extensions. odrive pollutes the filesystem with `.cloud`/`.cloudf`/`.cloudx` extensions that confuse applications, break file associations, and require extension-aware tooling.

### 5.4 Fleet Sync via NATS JetStream

TC's `tcfs-sync::nats` provides:
- `SYNC_TASKS` stream (work queue for push/pull/unsync)
- `HYDRATION_EVENTS` stream (FUSE hydration coordination)
- `STATE_UPDATES` stream (hierarchical `STATE.{device}.{event}` subjects)
- Per-device durable consumers with catch-up from last sequence

odrive is single-machine only -- no fleet awareness, no push notifications, no distributed work queue.

### 5.5 Modern Cryptography

TC's `tcfs-crypto` uses:
- XChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD (vs PyCrypto AES/Blowfish/DES/ARC4)
- Argon2id key derivation (vs generic KDF)
- Per-file random keys wrapped by master key (vs shared passphrase)
- AES-SIV for deterministic filename encryption
- HKDF for domain-separated subkeys
- BIP-39 mnemonic recovery phrases

odrive stores passphrases in plaintext SQLite. TC never persists secrets in plaintext.

### 5.6 Authentication (MFA + Device Enrollment)

TC's `tcfs-auth` provides:
- TOTP (RFC 6238) provider
- WebAuthn/FIDO2/passkey provider
- Device enrollment via cryptographic invite
- Session management with device identity and permissions
- Rate limiting with backoff

odrive has basic API key and OAuth -- no MFA, no device enrollment protocol.

### 5.7 Platform Integration Breadth

TC already has crates for:
- `tcfs-cloudfilter`: Windows Cloud Filter API (native cloud files)
- `tcfs-file-provider`: Apple FileProvider (iOS/macOS Files.app)
- `tcfs-dbus`: Linux D-Bus integration
- `tcfs-nfs`: NFSv3 backend for VFS

odrive only has Finder Sync Extension (macOS) and shell namespace (Windows).

### 5.8 gRPC + Streaming (vs JSON-over-TCP)

TC's gRPC service has:
- Typed protobuf messages (vs untyped JSON)
- Bidirectional streaming for `Push`, `Pull`, `Hydrate`, `Watch`
- Unix domain socket transport (lower overhead)
- Code generation for any language

odrive uses JSON-over-TCP with one connection per command, no multiplexing, no type safety.

### 5.9 Metrics and Observability

TC has Prometheus metrics (`tcfsd::metrics`), structured JSON logging via `tracing`, and an MCP integration (`tcfs-mcp`) for AI agent tooling. odrive sends telemetry to Mixpanel (proprietary, privacy concern).

## 7. Architectural Patterns Worth Adopting

### 7.1 Dual Local/Remote Attribute Model

**odrive pattern**: `SyncTrackingNode` stores both `localValues` and `remoteValues` as `SyncTrackingValuesV0`. This enables three-way comparison: base (stored) vs current-local vs current-remote.

**TC adaptation**: Extend `SyncState` to store `remote_blake3`, `remote_size`, `remote_mtime` alongside the existing local fields. This enables the reconciler to detect which side changed without fetching the remote manifest every time.

```rust
struct SyncState {
    // ... existing fields ...
    remote_blake3: String,    // last-known remote hash
    remote_size: u64,         // last-known remote size
    remote_vclock: VectorClock, // last-known remote vclock
}
```

### 7.2 Separate Event Controllers

**odrive pattern**: `LocalEventController`, `RemoteEventController`, and `TrackedEventController` handle different event sources with different processing logic.

**TC adaptation**: The current `FileWatcher` handles local events only. NATS `STATE_UPDATES` events are processed in the daemon worker loop. Formalize this into:
- `LocalEventHandler`: processes `FileWatcher` events -> enqueue push tasks
- `RemoteEventHandler`: processes NATS state events -> enqueue pull tasks
- `TrackedEventHandler`: monitors active operations for completion/failure

### 7.3 Schema Evolution via Column Detection

**odrive pattern**: `_has_column()` with `PRAGMA table_info()` checks for column existence before ALTER TABLE. This allows upgrading from older versions without data loss.

**TC adaptation**: TC's JSON state cache handles this via `#[serde(default)]` attributes (already used for `vclock` and `device_id` fields). The RocksDB backend should apply similar forward-compatible deserialization. If TC ever moves to SQLite, adopt odrive's ALTER TABLE pattern.

### 7.4 Operation Plan-Then-Execute

**odrive pattern**: The refresh pipeline produces a complete plan (list of Operations) before executing any of them. This allows validation, conflict detection, and user confirmation before any side effects.

**TC adaptation**: The reconciler (Section 3.6) should produce a `ReconciliationPlan`:
```rust
struct ReconciliationPlan {
    uploads: Vec<UploadOp>,
    downloads: Vec<DownloadOp>,
    conflicts: Vec<ConflictOp>,
    deletes: Vec<DeleteOp>,
    no_ops: usize,
}
```
This plan can be displayed to the user (via TUI or CLI), modified, and then executed. This is particularly important for first-time sync of large directories.

### 7.5 Queued Expansion with Priority/Retry

**odrive pattern**: `QueuedExpand` with `QueueWithRetries` implements a queue that has `put_front()` (high-priority retry) and `put_back()` (low-priority retry), with `InProgressFiles` limiting concurrent downloads by both count and bytes.

**TC adaptation**: TC's `SyncScheduler` already has priority levels. Extend it with:
- Byte-based concurrency limit (not just task count)
- Front-of-queue retry for recoverable errors
- Back-of-queue retry for rate-limited operations

## 8. Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 8.1 Plaintext Secret Storage

odrive stores encryption passphrases in plaintext in `EncryptionEntryTable` SQLite. This is a critical security flaw. TC's `tcfs-secrets` + `tcfs-crypto` approach (keyring, age, SOPS, never-plaintext) is correct and must be maintained.

### 8.2 Monolithic Provider Coupling

odrive bundles 27 provider adapters in a single binary. Each adapter has its own `BackoffChecker`, `Service` class, and `Sync9Adapter` -- tight coupling that makes the binary large and hard to maintain. TC's OpenDAL abstraction is cleaner; do not add per-provider code paths.

### 8.3 Python 2.7 Thread Pool (GIL)

odrive's `OxygenThreadPoolExecutor` is limited by Python's GIL -- true parallelism only exists for I/O-bound operations. TC's tokio async runtime has no such limitation and should not artificially replicate odrive's threading model.

### 8.4 Polling-Based Remote Detection

odrive polls remote providers at intervals because there is no universal push notification mechanism across 27 providers. TC has NATS JetStream push notifications and should never fall back to polling for remote state changes.

### 8.5 Extension-Based Placeholders

odrive's `.cloud`/`.cloudf`/`.cloudx` extension system pollutes the filesystem namespace, confuses applications, breaks file type associations, and creates nine(!) distinct extension types to handle encryption combinations. TC's FUSE-based virtual filesystem avoids all of these problems and must be preserved.

### 8.6 Implicit State Machine

odrive's `FileSyncState` enum exists but transitions are not formally guarded -- they happen through various code paths in controllers and services. TC should enforce state transitions through a proper state machine (e.g., `typestates` pattern or explicit transition methods that validate preconditions).

### 8.7 Mixpanel Telemetry

odrive's `MixpanelUtil` sends usage data to a third-party analytics service. TC should only use opt-in, self-hosted metrics (Prometheus) and structured logs. Never phone home without explicit user consent.

### 8.8 Timestamp-Based Conflict Detection

odrive's `Compare` module uses mtime/size as the primary conflict signal. This fails with clock skew, sub-second modifications, and copy operations that preserve mtime. TC's vector clock approach is mathematically correct and should remain the primary conflict detection mechanism.
