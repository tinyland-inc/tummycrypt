# tummycrypt / tcfs

> Under active development. Not yet stable. Expect breaking changes.

Self-hosted encrypted file sync with on-demand hydration. Mounts SeaweedFS as a local directory — files appear as zero-byte `.tc` stubs until accessed, then transparently download and decrypt. FOSS odrive/Dropbox replacement.

## Canonical Home

`Jesssullivan/tummycrypt` is the canonical source repository for tcfs.
If `tinyland-inc/tummycrypt` exists, treat it as a fork or downstream
distribution surface rather than the source of truth for planning, issues,
releases, or contributor workflow.

Operational policy: [`docs/ops/remote-governance.md`](docs/ops/remote-governance.md).

## Features

- **On-demand hydration**: Files appear as `.tc` stubs, hydrate transparently on open
- **E2E encryption**: XChaCha20-Poly1305 per-chunk, Argon2id KDF, BIP-39 recovery keys
- **Fleet sync**: Multi-machine sync via NATS JetStream with vector clock conflict detection
- **Content-addressed storage**: FastCDC chunking, BLAKE3 hashing, zstd compression
- **Git-safe**: Syncs `.git/` directories as atomic bundles with lock detection
- **Cross-platform**: Linux is the best-supported runtime; macOS has packaged but still experimental desktop surfaces; Windows remains planned

## Quick Start

```bash
# Nix devShell (recommended)
nix develop
# Or auto-load the committed devShell + env on cd
direnv allow

# Or manual: install the pinned Rust 1.93.0 toolchain, protobuf compiler, fuse3 (Linux)

# Start local dev infrastructure (SeaweedFS + NATS + Prometheus + Grafana)
task dev

# Build + test
task check
```

## Installation

```bash
# Linux (installer script)
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Jesssullivan/tummycrypt/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh

# macOS (Homebrew, current manual tap flow)
brew tap --custom-remote Jesssullivan/tummycrypt https://github.com/Jesssullivan/tummycrypt.git
git -C "$(brew --repo Jesssullivan/tummycrypt)" fetch origin homebrew-tap
git -C "$(brew --repo Jesssullivan/tummycrypt)" checkout homebrew-tap
brew install Jesssullivan/tummycrypt/tcfs

# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dpkg -i tcfsd-*.deb tcfs-*.deb

# RPM (Fedora/RHEL/Rocky, daemon-only today)
sudo rpm -i tcfsd-*.rpm

# Container (K8s worker mode)
podman pull ghcr.io/jesssullivan/tcfsd:latest

# Nix
nix build github:Jesssullivan/tummycrypt
```

## CLI

```bash
tcfs status                    # Daemon status, device identity, NATS connection
tcfs push <path>               # Upload with encryption + vector clock tick
tcfs pull <manifest> <local>   # Download with conflict detection + decryption
tcfs mount <remote> <target>   # FUSE mount with on-demand hydration
tcfs unsync <path>             # Convert hydrated file back to .tc stub
tcfs device enroll             # Register device with age keypair
tcfs device list               # Show enrolled fleet devices
```

## Binaries

| Binary | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `tcfs` | CLI: push, pull, mount, unsync, device management |
| `tcfsd` | Daemon: gRPC, FUSE mounts, NATS fleet sync, Prometheus metrics |
| `tcfs-tui` | Terminal UI: dashboard with sync status, conflicts, mounts |
| `tcfs-mcp` | MCP server: AI agent integration (8 tools, stdio transport) |
