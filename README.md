# tummycrypt / tcfs

> Under active development. Not yet stable. Expect breaking changes.

Current release: `v0.12.14` (tagged); `v0.12.15` is pending on `main`. The
Homebrew tap is stale at `0.12.12` and that formula skips symlinks.

Self-hosted encrypted file sync with on-demand hydration. The Linux FUSE mounted
view is host-proven for clean-name traversal, hydrate-on-open, mounted
write/readback, cache clear/rehydrate, and recursive safe-unsync; offline or
dehydrated sync-root copies can be represented by small `.tc`/`.tcf` stubs. FOSS
odrive/Dropbox-style alternative under active development.

## Canonical Home

`Jesssullivan/tummycrypt` is the canonical source repository for tcfs.
If `tinyland-inc/tummycrypt` exists, treat it as a fork or downstream
distribution surface rather than the source of truth for planning, issues,
releases, or contributor workflow.

Operational policy: [`docs/ops/remote-governance.md`](docs/ops/remote-governance.md).

- Feature/objective matrix: [docs/ops/feature-objective-matrix-2026-05-09.md](docs/ops/feature-objective-matrix-2026-05-09.md)
- Next fleet parity sprint: [docs/ops/fleet-parity-sprint-plan-2026-05-09.md](docs/ops/fleet-parity-sprint-plan-2026-05-09.md)
- Lazy traversal QA matrix: [docs/ops/lazy-traversal-qa-permutation-matrix-2026-05-09.md](docs/ops/lazy-traversal-qa-permutation-matrix-2026-05-09.md)
- Git repo dogfood canary: [docs/ops/git-repo-canary-dogfood.md](docs/ops/git-repo-canary-dogfood.md)
- Real project-tree canary lane: `task lazy:home-canary-linux-xr-shadow`;
  `home-canary-linux-xr-shadow-20260511T040325Z/` is scoped green for the
  isolated `linux-xr` shadow. The storage-posture lane now has a release-binary
  packet that completes the 7.7 GB shadow, proves honey mounted traversal and
  all 85 symlink targets on the same prefix, and proves the raw Git `.pack` and
  `.rev` object-count fixes. The mounted warning follow-up dropped S3
  `NoSuchKey` rows from 274 to 0 by preserving real `.tc` filenames during VFS
  lookup. A later lifecycle companion reused the same prefix and now reports
  `scoped-project-tree-parity-evidence-complete`; production S3/Finder posture
  remains separate because TLS endpoint posture, socket accounting,
  generated-large-file policy, and production desktop UX are still open
- Next dogfood lane: `task lazy:git-repo-canary` creates a shadow-first packet
  for one clean git worktree, defaulting to `~/git/oauth-mux`. It is the safe
  path toward repo mobility before any live repo, broad `~/git`, `~/Documents`,
  dotfile, or home-directory takeover. The current green small-repo packets are
  `docs/release/evidence/git-repo-canary-oauth-mux-sourcebin-fresh-20260515T014640Z/`
  for source-built binaries and
  `docs/release/evidence/git-repo-canary-oauth-mux-nixpkg-20260515T133843Z/`
  for explicit current Nix flake package binaries on both `neo` and `honey`.
  Both prove clean shadow push, 0 skipped symlinks, honey mounted
  traversal/hydration, 9 mounted symlink target checks, and the Linux lifecycle
  companion. Homebrew `0.12.12` remains stale and skips symlinks; live repo
  moves still need large-repo fresh-tree restore and package-backed
  restore/rollback proof.
  `task lazy:git-repo-restore-proof` now records that restore gate; the first
  Nix packet run timed out during `tcfs reconcile` remote-index dry-run and is
  archived as a blocker under the Nix packet. Follow-up source-built proofs fix
  the remote-index timeout and restore all 4,601 regular files plus 9 symlinks
  exactly. The source-built packet,
  `restore-proof-source-fix-empty-dirs-20260515T183805Z/`, also records
  `state_entry_count=4610`, `restored_symlink_state_count=9`, and exact restore
  of all 12 archived empty directories with `--require-empty-dirs`. The current
  rebuilt Nix flake package binary now proves that same fresh-tree restore gate
  in `restore-proof-nixpkg-current-empty-dirs-20260515T200359Z/`
  (`tcfs_sha256=5ee0939f2d1f02cada1c46e429849613b5303fb930e0039a4622d5b712df95a8`).
  Homebrew restore remains stale/unproven. The larger clean stress canary
  against `~/git/linux-xr-fast` is now green for source-built shadow push,
  honey mounted traversal/hydration, and the Linux lifecycle companion in
  `git-repo-canary-linux-xr-fast-sourcefix-index-20260516T045054Z/`. The
  source-built run proves the raw Git pack-index, temp-pack, and exact
  `.git/index` chunk-profile fixes, but its fresh-tree restore attempt remains
  a blocker: `restore-proof/` restored 2,036 of 2,038 regular files and all 6
  empty directories, then missed two multi-GB `.git/objects/pack/*.pack` files
  after transient chunk read failures. Commit `b1a6285` now streams restore
  downloads to disk instead of buffering entire files and cleans failed temp
  files, but a full large-restore rerun is still pending enough local restore
  headroom. Live repo moves, Homebrew readiness, package-backed
  restore/rollback, production Finder, broad `~/git`, and home-directory
  takeover remain unclaimed.
- Current production Finder truth: the May 18 PZM self-hosted Developer ID
  lane closed the old read-timeout blocker. Run `26062554542` proved installed
  strict preflight, storage `[ok]`, domain add, CloudStorage enumeration,
  exact-content hydrate, evict/rehydrate, mutation upload/readback, and
  conflict-status preservation through a notarized production `.pkg` without
  `fileprovider_testing_mode=true`. The remaining macOS gaps are first-run
  UX from installer to valid config/status, continuous per-tag release smoke,
  and badge/progress/recovery assertions rather than basic FileProvider
  hydration.

- Repo roam (dev-env zero-diff): forward `neo -> honey` roam of a real repo's full
  in-progress state is PROVEN (2026-06-09), evidence
  `docs/release/evidence/repo-roam-canary-20260609/`. See
  [Roam an in-progress repo across machines](#roam-an-in-progress-repo-across-machines).

## Roam an in-progress repo across machines

The "machine doesn't matter" goal: enroll a `~/git` repo once, and your in-progress
work — current branch, staged and unstaged edits, untracked files, stashes, and full
history — follows you to every machine, encrypted end to end. `ssh` into any enrolled
host, `cd` into the repo, and pick up exactly where you left off.

**Proven, live, forward direction (2026-06-09).** On the two-machine `neo`/`honey`
fleet, a real repo's complete dev-env state roamed `neo -> honey` byte- and
semantically identical — `dev-env-zero-diff=pass`, `git fsck` clean on both sides —
covering a feature branch, a staged change, an unstaged change, an untracked file,
and a stash. Evidence: `docs/release/evidence/repo-roam-canary-20260609/`.

**How it works.** A scheduled `tcfs reconcile --path <repo> --prefix <prefix>
--execute` unit syncs the whole repo *including `.git`* as ordinary encrypted files
(`[sync] sync_git_dirs = true`, `git_sync_mode = "raw"`) to object storage; the peer
host pulls it on its own cycle or on demand. Only changed chunks move, and the
fail-closed deny-set keeps secrets, `.env`, and live database/WAL files out. The repo
files land directly in `~/git/<repo>` on each host — no mount required for the repo
itself (distinct from the lazy on-open hydration of the `~/tcfs` view).

**Prove it yourself (`neo -> honey`).** With a repo enrolled at `~/git/<repo>` (point
the unit at any small, expendable repo):

```bash
# 1) Source host: leave some in-progress work
cd ~/git/<repo>
git switch -c wip/roam-demo
printf 'scratch\n' > NOTES.scratch          # untracked
"$EDITOR" path/to/tracked-file              # unstaged edit
git add path/to/other-file                  # staged edit
git stash push -m demo -- path/to/third     # a stash

# 2) Push now, or just wait for the ~5-minute scheduled cycle.
#    macOS source host:
launchctl kickstart -k "gui/$(id -u)/dev.tinyland.tcfsd-reconcile-<unit>"
#    Linux source host:
systemctl --user start tcfsd-reconcile-<unit>.service

# 3) Other host: pick the work up over ssh and traverse into the repo
ssh <other-host>
cd ~/git/<repo>
git update-index --refresh -q   # settle the stat cache after the pull
git status                      # SAME branch + staged + unstaged + untracked
git stash list                  # SAME stash
git log --oneline -1            # SAME HEAD; full history present
git fsck                        # clean
```

Turn the eyeball check into a hard pass/fail gate — capture a fingerprint on each
host and compare; identical fingerprints mean a true zero-diff dev environment:

```bash
scripts/repo-roam-fingerprint.sh capture ~/git/<repo> /tmp/fp-source   # on source
scripts/repo-roam-fingerprint.sh capture ~/git/<repo> /tmp/fp-peer     # on peer
scripts/repo-roam-fingerprint.sh compare /tmp/fp-source /tmp/fp-peer    # exit 0 = zero-diff
```

Runbook: [docs/ops/repo-roam-test-plan-2026-06-08.md](docs/ops/repo-roam-test-plan-2026-06-08.md).

**Boundary (not yet).** Two hosts editing the *same* repo concurrently do not
auto-converge: divergent `.git` refs/index trip vector-clock conflict detection that
is not yet `.git`-aware. Until that lands, use a one-writer-at-a-time handoff —
quiesce one side before the other writes.

## Features

- **On-demand hydration**: Linux FUSE mounted files list as normal names and hydrate transparently on open
- **E2E encryption core path**: XChaCha20-Poly1305 per-chunk, Argon2id KDF, BIP-39 recovery keys; per-surface proof varies
- **Fleet sync**: Multi-machine sync via NATS JetStream with vector clock conflict detection
- **Content-addressed storage**: FastCDC chunking, BLAKE3 hashing, zstd compression
- **Git-safe**: Syncs `.git/` directories as atomic bundles with lock detection
- **Cross-platform**: Linux is the best-supported runtime; macOS has packaged but still experimental desktop surfaces; Windows remains planned

## Quick Start

```bash
# Nix devShell (recommended)
nix develop
# Or auto-load the committed devShell + env on cd
direnv allow

# Or manual: install the pinned Rust 1.93.0 toolchain, protobuf compiler, fuse3 (Linux)

# Start local dev infrastructure (SeaweedFS + NATS + Prometheus + Grafana)
task dev

# Build + test
task check
```

## Installation

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew, current manual tap flow)
# NOTE: the tap is stale at 0.12.12 and that formula skips symlinks;
# prefer the Nix tagged install below for the current release.
brew tap --custom-remote Jesssullivan/tummycrypt https://github.com/Jesssullivan/tummycrypt.git
git -C "$(brew --repo Jesssullivan/tummycrypt)" fetch origin homebrew-tap
git -C "$(brew --repo Jesssullivan/tummycrypt)" checkout homebrew-tap
brew install Jesssullivan/tummycrypt/tcfs

# Ubuntu 24.04+ / Debian 13+
sudo dpkg -i tcfsd-*.deb tcfs-*.deb

# RPM (Fedora 42 x86_64 proven; RHEL/Rocky pending, daemon-only today)
sudo rpm -i tcfsd-*.rpm

# Container (K8s worker mode; image build/signature published through
# v0.12.14, runtime smoke pending)
podman pull ghcr.io/jesssullivan/tcfsd:v0.12.14

# Nix tagged profile install
TAG=v0.12.14
nix profile install \
  "github:Jesssullivan/tummycrypt?ref=${TAG}#tcfsd" \
  "github:Jesssullivan/tummycrypt?ref=${TAG}#tcfs-cli"

# Linux/macOS tarball convenience installer
# Fast CLI install, but not part of the canonical release-proof surface.
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Jesssullivan/tummycrypt/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

## CLI

```bash
tcfs status                    # Daemon status, device identity, NATS connection
tcfs push <path>               # Upload with encryption + vector clock tick
tcfs pull <manifest> <local>   # Download with conflict detection + decryption
tcfs index inspect <path>      # Read-only remote index/manifest diagnostic
tcfs mount <remote> <target>   # Linux FUSE mount with clean-name on-demand hydration
tcfs unsync <path>             # Convert clean tracked files/directories back to .tc stubs
tcfs device enroll             # Register device with age keypair
tcfs device list               # Show enrolled fleet devices
```
