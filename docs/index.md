# tcfs — TummyCrypt Filesystem

**FOSS self-hosted odrive-style encrypted sync target**

tcfs is a self-hosted encrypted file sync system backed by [SeaweedFS](https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs) with core file-content XChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption, SOPS/age-managed credentials, content-defined chunking, Linux FUSE clean-name on-demand hydration, physical `.tc`/`.tcf` stubs for offline/dehydrated paths, and multi-machine fleet sync with vector clocks. Linux is the best-supported runtime today; Apple desktop and mobile surfaces exist but are still experimental.

## Installation

### Binary Releases

`Jesssullivan/tummycrypt` is the canonical source repository. Downstream org
forks may exist for distribution, but releases and source references should
default here.

Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Jesssullivan/tummycrypt/releases):

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew, current manual tap flow)
brew tap --custom-remote Jesssullivan/tummycrypt https://github.com/Jesssullivan/tummycrypt.git
git -C "$(brew --repo Jesssullivan/tummycrypt)" fetch origin homebrew-tap
git -C "$(brew --repo Jesssullivan/tummycrypt)" checkout homebrew-tap
brew install Jesssullivan/tummycrypt/tcfs

# Ubuntu 24.04+ / Debian 13+
sudo dpkg -i tcfsd-*.deb tcfs-*.deb

# RPM (Fedora 42 x86_64 proven; RHEL/Rocky pending, daemon-only today)
sudo rpm -i tcfsd-*.rpm

# Nix tagged profile install
TAG=v0.12.12
nix profile install \
  "github:Jesssullivan/tummycrypt?ref=${TAG}#tcfsd" \
  "github:Jesssullivan/tummycrypt?ref=${TAG}#tcfs-cli"

# Linux/macOS tarball convenience installer
# Fast CLI install, but not part of the canonical release-proof surface.
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Jesssullivan/tummycrypt/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

### Container (K8s worker mode)

```bash
podman pull --arch amd64 ghcr.io/jesssullivan/tcfsd:v0.12.12
```

### From Source

```bash
# Requires the pinned Rust 1.93.0 toolchain (see rust-toolchain.toml), protoc, libfuse3-dev
git clone https://github.com/Jesssullivan/tummycrypt.git
cd tummycrypt
cargo build --release
# Binaries: target/release/tcfs, target/release/tcfsd, target/release/tcfs-tui, target/release/tcfs-mcp
```

### Nix

```bash
nix build github:Jesssullivan/tummycrypt
# Or enter a devShell:
nix develop github:Jesssullivan/tummycrypt
```

## How It Works

1. **Push**: Files are split into content-defined chunks (FastCDC), compressed (zstd), encrypted client-side with XChaCha20-Poly1305, and uploaded to SeaweedFS via S3. Vector clock is ticked and SyncManifest v2 (JSON) is written.
2. **Pull**: Manifests describe the chunk layout. Chunks are fetched, verified (BLAKE3), decrypted, decompressed, and reassembled. Vector clock is merged with remote.
3. **Mount**: The local filesystem surface presents remote files as local names and hydrates on open. On Linux this is exercised primarily through FUSE. Apple desktop surfaces are still evolving and should be treated as experimental.
4. **Unsync**: Convert hydrated files back to physical `.tc` stubs or platform placeholders, reclaiming disk space while keeping the remote copy.
5. **Fleet Sync**: NATS JetStream distributes `StateEvent` messages across devices. Vector clocks detect conflicts; pluggable resolvers handle them (auto, interactive, or defer).

### Design Documents (LaTeX → PDF)

Technical design docs are maintained as LaTeX source and built to PDF by CI:

- [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) ([source](tex/architecture.tex)) — system design, crate map, hydration sequence
- [Protocol](PROTOCOL.md) ([source](tex/protocol.tex)) — wire format, chunk layout, manifest schema, gRPC RPCs
- [Security](SECURITY.md) ([source](tex/security.tex)) — threat model, encryption architecture

## Platform Support

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Linux x86_64 | Proven primary lane | Host-proven FUSE lifecycle plus CLI/daemon surfaces; packaged first-use/systemd remains a separate gate |
| Linux aarch64 | Available | Release tarball and `.deb`; FUSE is not built in the current cross-compiled release artifact |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | Experimental | CLI and daemon build, release `.pkg`, and FileProvider packaging exist, but user-facing acceptance coverage is still limited |
| macOS (Intel) | Experimental | CLI binaries ship, but the desktop integration story is not yet as proven as Linux |
| Windows x86_64 | Planned / skeleton | Cloud Files API skeleton; no release-grade CLI, daemon, or Explorer flow |
| iOS | Proof-of-concept | FileProvider direction with unproven write hooks; CI type-checks Swift, but there is no continuously proven device/TestFlight/App Store lane |
| Nix package/profile | Available / Darwin evidence current | Flake package/profile install is proven on Darwin for `v0.12.12`; Linux Nix install proof and NixOS module host proof are separate |
| NixOS module | Available / host evidence pending | NixOS and Home Manager modules exist, but current evidence is not a NixOS host acceptance run |
