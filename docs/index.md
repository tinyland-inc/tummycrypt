# TCFS documentation

TCFS is a self-hosted encrypted filesystem and sync fabric with content-addressed
storage, vector-clock conflict detection, selective hydration, and native or
userspace client surfaces. Linux is the strongest runtime today.

## Product spine

Read these in order:

1. [README](../README.md) — concise capability and development entry point.
2. [Vision](VISION.md) — hydratable-anywhere north star and program fit.
3. [Product](PRODUCT.md) — accepted A → B → C sequence, root identity, and
   proof ladder.
4. [Current workstream](ops/current.md) — living blockers and next operator
   ceremony.

These are the only general documents allowed to call themselves current.
Dated plans are evidence or historical context unless the current workstream
explicitly promotes them.

## Architecture and protocol

- [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) — system and crate overview.

- [Lab host acceptance](ops/lab-host-acceptance-matrix.md)
- [Apple surface status](ops/apple-surface-status.md) — historical client-state
  snapshot, not a current readiness claim.
- [macOS FileProvider reality](ops/macos-fileprovider-reality.md) — historical
  Finder/FileProvider proof snapshot.
- [iOS surface status](ops/ios-surface-status.md) — historical proof-of-concept
  boundary.
- [odrive behavior horizon](ops/odrive-parity-product-horizon.md) — historical
  product-horizon comparison.

## Evidence and history

- [Evidence index](release/evidence/README.md) — immutable proof packets.
- [Release evidence](release/) — release-specific matrices and results.
- [Archive](archive/README.md) — history pointers, not active instructions.

The Git repository is the full archive. Removed obsolete design and instruction
files remain available by commit without occupying the active documentation or
agent-instruction namespace.
