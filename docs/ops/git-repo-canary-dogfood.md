# TCFS Git Repo Canary Dogfood

This runbook is the next step between isolated fixture proof and real
`~/git` management. It is intentionally shadow-first: the source repo is
inventoried read-only, copied into `~/TCFS Pilot/real-canaries/`, and only the
shadow is pushed or exercised through TCFS.

## Current Readiness

Use the Linux/FUSE lane for the first real repo dogfood. The strongest current
proof is the archived `linux-xr` isolated-shadow lifecycle packet, which proves
remote traversal, selected hydration, mounted write/readback, cache
clear/rehydrate, recursive safe-unsync refusal/success, and symlink target
preservation on `honey`.

The generic `oauth-mux` canary is now green when both hosts use either
source-built binaries from current source or explicit current Nix flake package
binaries. The packet
`docs/release/evidence/git-repo-canary-oauth-mux-sourcebin-fresh-20260515T014640Z/`
uses source-built `tcfs` on `neo` for the push and a Nix-built current-source
Linux `tcfs` on `honey` for mounted traversal/hydration, mounted symlink target
checks, and the Linux lifecycle companion. It proves the shadow-first workflow
for one clean repo; it does not make live `~/git/oauth-mux` managed by TCFS.
The package-backed packet
`docs/release/evidence/git-repo-canary-oauth-mux-nixpkg-20260515T133843Z/`
uses current Nix flake package binaries on both `neo` and `honey`, publishes
4,601 regular files / 356,520,343 bytes with 0 skipped symlinks, verifies all 9
mounted symlink targets on honey, and passes the same Linux lifecycle companion.

The remaining package blocker is Homebrew. The installed Homebrew
`tcfs 0.12.12` binary skips symlinks even when the canary config sets
`sync_symlinks = true`; current-checkout Nix and source-built `tcfs 0.12.12`
preserve the same tiny symlink fixture in
`docs/release/evidence/tcfs-symlink-package-probe-20260515T041947Z/`. A follow-up
tiny mounted probe,
`docs/release/evidence/tcfs-symlink-package-probe-20260515T051126Z/`, proves a
neo current-checkout Nix producer can be mounted and read on honey with the
current source-built Linux binary, including `link.txt -> target.txt`. A second
follow-up, `docs/release/evidence/tcfs-symlink-package-probe-20260515T060330Z/`,
proves the same tiny mounted parse/target check with current Nix flake packages
on both neo and honey. This is still not Homebrew proof: installed Homebrew
continues to skip symlinks. The next gates before moving live repos into TCFS
are Homebrew rebuild/publish if Homebrew is the client lane, a green large-repo
fresh-tree restore, and package-backed restore/rollback proof.

The current `linux-xr-fast` source-built stress packet is green for shadow
push, honey mounted traversal/hydration, and Linux lifecycle, but it is not yet
green for fresh-tree restore. Earlier package attempts,
`git-repo-canary-linux-xr-fast-nixpkg-20260516T005236Z/` and
`git-repo-canary-linux-xr-fast-nixpkg-tuned-20260516T010911Z/`, established the
clean `xr/main` shadow shape: 2,038 regular files, 0 symlinks, 0 unsupported
special files, and about 8.2 GB of mostly `.git` data. They stalled on a 387 MB
`.git/objects/pack/*.idx` upload. Follow-up source-built packets then proved
the raw-Git object-count fixes for pack indexes, extensionless `tmp_pack_*`
files, and the exact `.git/index` file. The latest packet,
`git-repo-canary-linux-xr-fast-sourcefix-index-20260516T045054Z/`, completes the
source-built push with 2,038 uploaded rows / 8,702,124,366 bytes / 6,740 chunks,
zero skipped symlinks, and a green honey/lifecycle companion. Its
`restore-proof/` attempt restored 2,036 of 2,038 regular files and all 6 empty
directories, then missed two multi-GB `.git/objects/pack/*.pack` files after
transient chunk read failures. Commit `b1a6285` hardens the restore path by
streaming chunks directly to a unique temp file, hashing incrementally, and
removing failed temp files, but this has not yet been re-proven against the
full `linux-xr-fast` restore because the current neo disk headroom is too low
for an honest 8.7 GB restore plus overhead. Treat green large restore proof as
the current blocker before any live repo move.

The small-repo fresh-tree restore gate is green for source-built and current
Nix package binaries, including empty directories.
`task lazy:git-repo-restore-proof` takes an existing pushed canary packet,
restores into `~/TCFS Pilot/restore-proofs/`, and archives regular-file hash,
symlink-target, empty-dir, state, and reconcile logs under a proof directory.
The first run against
`docs/release/evidence/git-repo-canary-oauth-mux-nixpkg-20260515T133843Z/`
timed out during `tcfs reconcile` dry-run remote-index scanning after 120s,
before any restore mutation. The source-built follow-up
`restore-proof-source-fix-empty-dirs-20260515T183805Z/` restores 4,601 regular
files, 9 symlinks, synced state for all 4,610 restored paths, and all 12
archived empty directories with `--require-empty-dirs`. The larger
`linux-xr-fast` restore gate is still blocked by the two failed multi-GB Git
pack pulls above. Treat packaged Nix/Homebrew restore, Homebrew symlink
readiness, and a green large-repo restore/rollback proof as remaining gates
before live repo moves.

Use `task lazy:tcfs-symlink-package-probe` to recheck packaged or candidate
binaries before repeating the real repo canary. The helper writes a fresh
evidence packet with each candidate binary path, version, SHA-256, config, push
log, and a `preserved` / `skipped` / `push_failed` symlink verdict. Add
`--run-honey-mount` when the candidate should also prove mounted parse and
target verification on honey. A package candidate is not dogfood-ready until
this probe reports `overall_status=passed` and the honey mount can parse and
verify the same symlink index format using the packaged/current consumer binary.
Current Nix flake producer/consumer proof is green for both the tiny fixture and
the clean `oauth-mux` shadow canary; Homebrew is the remaining package-current
blocker.

Do not use the current `neo` Finder/CloudStorage root for active repos yet. The
May 17 packets prove a notarized workflow artifact installed into
`/Applications`, stale user/build registration cleanup after inventory, strict
installed preflight, package daemon storage, domain add, enumeration, and
`requestDownload`. Active repos should still wait until exact-content
production Finder hydration, evict/rehydrate, mutation, and conflict/status
proof pass.

## Default Canary Order

1. `~/git/oauth-mux` shadow: small, clean, low-risk first proof.
2. `~/git/linux-xr-fast` shadow: repeat large clean stress proof with a selected
   candidate binary/package, enough local free space for full restore, and
   download retry posture suitable for multi-GB Git pack pulls.
3. One expendable live repo: only after the shadow packet proves restore from
   remote, cross-host rehydrate, and safe-unsync behavior.
4. Selected `~/git` or `~/Documents` subtrees: only after several repo canaries
   have boring transcripts on at least two machines.

Keep `~/git/linux-xr` inventory-only unless direct live mutation is explicitly
approved. Keep `finances`, secrets, package caches, dotfiles, `.local`,
keychains, and broad home-directory takeover out of this lane.

## Task Surface

Plan-only inventory and shadow packet for the default small repo:

```bash
task lazy:git-repo-canary
```

Explicit small repo run:

```bash
SOURCE="$HOME/git/oauth-mux" \
NAME=oauth-mux \
REMOTE=seaweedfs://HOST:8333/tcfs/git-repo-canary-oauth-mux-manual \
task lazy:git-repo-canary
```

Cross-host proof after the disposable remote and honey credentials are ready:

```bash
SOURCE="$HOME/git/oauth-mux" \
NAME=oauth-mux \
REMOTE=seaweedfs://HOST:8333/tcfs/git-repo-canary-oauth-mux-manual \
PUSH=1 \
RUN_HONEY=1 \
HONEY_START_MOUNT=1 \
RUN_LINUX_LIFECYCLE=1 \
task lazy:git-repo-canary
```

Until the package lane is rebuilt, pass explicit current-source binaries:

```bash
TCFS_BIN="$PWD/target/codex-verify/debug/tcfs" \
HONEY_TCFS_BIN=/path/on/honey/to/current-source/tcfs \
TCFS_HONEY_EXPECTED_SHA256=<sha256> \
PUSH=1 \
RUN_HONEY=1 \
HONEY_START_MOUNT=1 \
RUN_LINUX_LIFECYCLE=1 \
task lazy:git-repo-canary
```

Package/current symlink probe:

```bash
CANDIDATES="homebrew=/opt/homebrew/opt/tcfs/bin/tcfs source_built=$PWD/target/codex-verify/debug/tcfs" \
ENDPOINT=http://HOST:8333 \
BUCKET=tcfs \
task lazy:tcfs-symlink-package-probe
```

Tiny mounted parse/target proof after choosing one preserved producer:

```bash
scripts/tcfs-symlink-package-probe.sh \
  --endpoint http://HOST:8333 \
  --bucket tcfs \
  --candidate nix_current=/nix/store/...-tcfs-cli-0.12.12/bin/tcfs \
  --run-honey-mount \
  --mount-label nix_current \
  --honey-tcfs-bin /path/on/honey/to/tcfs
```

Large clean repo stress pass:

```bash
SOURCE="$HOME/git/linux-xr-fast" \
NAME=linux-xr-fast \
REMOTE=seaweedfs://HOST:8333/tcfs/git-repo-canary-linux-xr-fast-manual \
task lazy:git-repo-canary
```

Fresh-tree restore/rollback proof for an existing pushed packet:

```bash
EVIDENCE_DIR=docs/release/evidence/git-repo-canary-oauth-mux-nixpkg-20260515T133843Z \
task lazy:git-repo-restore-proof
```

Use `RESTORE_RECONCILE_TIMEOUT_SECS=<seconds>` to bound each reconcile command.
Use `TCFS_DOWNLOAD_CHUNK_RETRIES=<attempts>` when rerunning large restore
proofs against a noisy storage endpoint; the default is 8 and the code caps the
value at 32.
Use `TCFS_DOWNLOAD_READ_TIMEOUT_SECS=<seconds>` to bound each manifest/chunk
read attempt during restore; the default is 300 seconds, the cap is 3600
seconds, and `0` disables the per-attempt timeout.
Use `RESTORE_PROOF_DIR=<packet>/restore-proof-<label>` when adding a follow-up
proof without overwriting an earlier blocker packet.
Use `REQUIRE_EMPTY_DIRS=1` only when empty-directory parity is part of the gate.

The helper refuses dirty worktrees unless `ALLOW_DIRTY_SOURCE=1` or
`--allow-dirty-source` is set. Dirty snapshots are allowed only as explicit
evidence; they are not a default dogfood target.

## Evidence Boundary

Every packet writes `git-repo-canary-policy.env` and
`git-repo-canary-summary.md` beside the inherited source/shadow inventory,
TCFS config, and optional push/honey/lifecycle transcripts.
When a later resume pass runs honey or lifecycle proof, `run-metadata.env`
describes the final pass and `push-run-metadata.env` preserves the original
push-time binary/concurrency settings.

Claims allowed from this lane:

- one git worktree can be copied to a shadow and represented with TCFS config
- if `PUSH=1`, the shadow can publish to a disposable prefix
- if `RUN_HONEY=1`, a second Linux host can traverse and hydrate selected files
- if `RUN_LINUX_LIFECYCLE=1`, the mounted write/readback, cache
  clear/rehydrate, and safe-unsync lifecycle passed for that prefix
- scoped project-tree parity only when `parity-gates.env` reports
  `scoped-project-tree-parity-evidence-complete`; if `push.log` contains
  skipped symlink rows, the packet remains a blocker even if the file push
  itself exits successfully
- symlink preservation means remote/mounted symlink target proof. Local
  `sync-status` and recursive `unsync` remain regular-file-oriented for now, so
  do not use symlink status rows as a readiness claim.

Claims not allowed:

- the live source repo was managed by TCFS
- Finder/FileProvider is production ready
- broad `~/git`, `~/Documents`, dotfiles, `.local`, or full home takeover is
  ready
- production S3 posture is closed

## Exit Bar Before Moving A Live Repo

A live repo can become a candidate only after a shadow packet proves all of:

1. source inventory, shadow inventory, and unsupported-file policy are archived
2. exact remote push and pullback pass
3. honey traversal before full hydration passes
4. selected file hydration returns exact source bytes
5. mounted edit/readback preserves exact bytes
6. clean recursive `tcfs unsync` succeeds and dirty recursive unsync refuses
7. exact rehydrate after unsync/cache-clear passes
8. rollback is demonstrated by recreating a fresh local tree from the remote
   prefix. This gate is green for the current Nix `oauth-mux` shadow packet,
   but must still be repeated for any larger live-repo candidate before moving
   that repo into TCFS.
9. source symlinks are not skipped during push and rehydrate as symlinks with
   exact matching targets

The broader "machine does not matter" claim has an additional acceptance matrix:
[git-roam-daily-driver-acceptance-2026-06-08.md](git-roam-daily-driver-acceptance-2026-06-08.md).
That matrix must pass for dirty WIP, Git metadata, agent context, unsync,
conflict behavior, and reverse-origin flow before citing any repo canary as
daily-driver `~/git` readiness.
