# Apple Surface Status

As of May 17, 2026, Apple support is a buildable and partially proven lane. The
macOS FileProvider testing-mode lab now has green enumerate, hydrate, evict,
rehydrate, mutation upload/readback, and deterministic conflict/status content
preservation proof on PZM, but Apple surfaces are still not a full
release-grade desktop or iOS product.

## macOS: Proven Today

- CI proves the Rust staticlib/header needed for FileProvider packaging, plus
  the iOS Swift type-check lane. The regular CI workflow does not yet build the
  macOS FileProvider Swift bundle.
- Release automation can build Apple Silicon artifacts, package
  `TCFSProvider.app`, and publish `.pkg` plus tarball assets.
- The repo contains real macOS daemon, launchd, NFS loopback, and FileProvider
  code paths.
- The `petting-zoo-mini` lab lane can build a non-production testing-mode
  package with Mac App Development profiles and Apple's
  `com.apple.developer.fileprovider.testing-mode` entitlement.
- PZM smoke run `25446601375` on `v0.12.11` proved package install,
  signing/profile checks, shared-Keychain config, live S3/E2EE access, daemon
  startup, FileProvider registration, CloudStorage enumeration,
  `requestDownload`, and exact-content hydration.
- PZM smoke run `25562087555` on `v0.12.12` with the installed
  `TCFS FileProvider Lab Gatekeeper Rules` profile proved installed host
  policy launch, shared-Keychain config, live S3/E2EE access, daemon startup,
  FileProvider registration, CloudStorage enumeration, `requestDownload`,
  `evict`, re-`requestDownload`, and exact-content hydration.
- PZM package run `25565895586` and smoke run `25565943781` extended the same
  testing-mode lane into mutation proof: write through CloudStorage, exact
  remote pull of the 68-byte mutated file, and post-mutation `tcfs status`
  showing storage `[ok]`.
- PZM package run `25569345240` and smoke run `25569596910` extended the lane
  into deterministic conflict/status proof: CLI status reported
  `sync state: conflict` and FileProvider readback preserved exact content.
  Finder badges/progress remain observational.
- Local neo cleanup packet
  `docs/release/evidence/macos-fileprovider-neo-pkg-install-20260516T024006Z/`
  verifies the published `v0.12.12` `.pkg` signature/notarization and
  quarantines the stale `~/Applications/TCFSProvider.app`, but the package did
  not install because non-interactive `sudo` required a password.
- Local neo source-built signed app packet
  `docs/release/evidence/macos-fileprovider-signed-app-preflight-20260516T183213Z/`
  proves the build script can embed the compatible local Developer ID host and
  extension profiles and pass strict signing-only preflight. It does not prove
  `.pkg` install, PlugInKit cleanup, or Finder lifecycle.
- Local neo candidate package packet
  `docs/release/evidence/macos-fileprovider-candidate-pkg-20260516T190702Z/`
  proves the signed app can be wrapped with current source-built `tcfs`/`tcfsd`
  into a Developer ID Installer signed `.pkg` whose payload and postinstall
  structure pass the non-installing smoke. It does not install or register the
  app.
- Follow-up packet
  `docs/release/evidence/macos-fileprovider-candidate-pkg-assessment-20260516T194612Z/`
  confirms the same candidate package has a valid Developer ID Installer
  signature and expected expanded payload, but Gatekeeper install assessment
  rejects it as `Unnotarized Developer ID` and `stapler validate` reports no
  stapled ticket.
- Remote proof packet
  `docs/release/evidence/macos-fileprovider-pkg-notarization-proof-20260516T211425Z/`
  records GitHub Actions run `25973109986`: a source-built arm64 macOS package
  was Developer ID signed, submitted to Apple notary service, accepted,
  stapled, validated, accepted by Gatekeeper install assessment, and passed
  strict package smoke with signature, Gatekeeper, and stapled-ticket checks
  required. This is a workflow artifact proof, not a published release asset or
  an installed Finder lifecycle proof.
- Local neo packet
  `docs/release/evidence/macos-fileprovider-neo-notarized-pkg-inventory-20260516T222519Z/`
  downloads that notarized workflow artifact, verifies SHA-256
  `c6fd1a6fd18638c53f0d0b88bc79249e65d08766d99853bef6896ee69bcd6d45`, and
  reruns strict package smoke locally with signature, Gatekeeper, and
  stapled-ticket checks required. The same inventory still shows no canonical
  `/Applications/TCFSProvider.app` and a stale user-app PlugInKit registration.
- Local neo install packet
  `docs/release/evidence/macos-fileprovider-neo-notarized-pkg-install-20260516T222606Z/`
  attempts the real `/` install from that notarized package and records the
  historical blocker: `sudo -n installer` requires a password, so no payload
  was installed and strict production preflight still fails on the missing
  `/Applications/TCFSProvider.app`.
- Local neo install packet
  `docs/release/evidence/macos-fileprovider-neo-notarized-pkg-install-auth-20260517T005618Z/`
  supersedes that admin-auth blocker for the workflow artifact: the notarized
  package installed into `/Applications` with authenticated `osascript`, but
  strict preflight still found duplicate PlugInKit registrations.
- Local neo cleanup and preflight packets
  `docs/release/evidence/macos-fileprovider-neo-stale-userapp-quarantine-20260517T010423Z/`
  and
  `docs/release/evidence/macos-fileprovider-neo-strict-preflight-installed-20260517T010916Z/`
  intentionally quarantine the stale user app after inventory, then prove
  strict installed preflight with one PlugInKit registration under
  `/Applications/TCFSProvider.app`.
- Local neo daemon packet
  `docs/release/evidence/macos-fileprovider-neo-package-daemon-env-20260517T012916Z/`
  removes the stale user daemon from the bounded process set and proves package
  `tcfsd 0.12.12` reaches storage `[ok]` from file-backed credentials.
- Local neo Finder packets now reach production-signed domain add,
  CloudStorage enumeration, and host-app `requestDownload`; the current
  blocker packet
  `docs/release/evidence/macos-fileprovider-neo-finder-release-smoke-directhost-catread-20260517T020417Z/`
  still fails the real read with `Operation timed out`.
- GitHub Actions links for the current PZM runs are indexed in
  [Release Evidence Index](../release/evidence/README.md).

## macOS: Not Yet Proven As A Release-Grade Desktop Surface

- There is no continuously exercised production Finder/FileProvider acceptance
  lane from Developer ID package install through user enablement, enumerate,
  hydrate, mutate, and conflict handling.
- Finder badges, progress UI, and notification behavior are not release gates.
- The green PZM lane is intentionally non-production testing-mode evidence; it
  does not mean arbitrary clean production Macs will auto-enable the provider.
- Published macOS artifacts still require explicit post-cut smoke even when CI
  and packaging are green; the notarized workflow artifact does not replace
  current-tag release install evidence.
- Neo local dogfood has an authenticated install, intentional stale-registration
  cleanup after inventory, full strict production preflight, and package daemon
  storage proof. It still needs exact-content FileProvider hydration through
  the installed production app before any Finder readiness claim.

## iOS: Current Posture

- The repo carries real iOS FileProvider and UniFFI code plus CI Swift
  type-check coverage.
- There is still no continuously exercised simulator or device acceptance lane.
- There is no repeatable TestFlight or App Store delivery path.
- Treat iOS as proof-of-concept and read-only in practice until stronger
  end-to-end evidence exists.

## Working Wording

Use:

- `macOS: CLI/daemon plus lab-proven experimental FileProvider lifecycle`
- `iOS: proof-of-concept FileProvider direction`

Avoid:

- `macOS: full` or `production-ready`
- `iOS: active release target`
- claims that production Finder badges, mutation, conflict UX, or arbitrary
  clean-host enablement are release-verified

## Validation Path

- Keep the Apple CI lanes green.
- Run post-release distribution smoke from
  [Distribution Smoke Matrix](distribution-smoke-matrix.md).
- Use [macOS Finder and FileProvider Reality](macos-fileprovider-reality.md) for
  the current desktop acceptance path and proof gaps.
- Keep extending the named macOS Finder/FileProvider smoke path, but do not
  upgrade the public desktop posture until production Developer ID clean-host
  acceptance is green.
- Add simulator or device-backed iOS acceptance before claiming an active iOS
  product surface.

## Posture

Treat Apple surfaces as buildable and manually explorable, but experimental.

That means:

- keep the Swift and Rust Apple code paths compiling
- keep macOS packaging and codesigning flows functional
- allow manual TestFlight or local FileProvider experiments
- avoid claiming production-ready Finder or iOS parity until stronger evidence
  exists

## Why `swift/fileprovider` And `swift/ios` Both Exist

- `swift/fileprovider` is the macOS packaging lane: FileProvider bundle
  assembly, Finder-related integration, notarization helpers, and macOS app
  artifacts
- `swift/ios` is the iOS lane: host app, iOS FileProvider extension, xcodegen
  project spec, and manual TestFlight or upload tooling

They are related, but they do not represent the same shipping surface.

## Exit Criteria To Become An Active Release Target

- A production macOS Finder/FileProvider smoke path for clean-host enablement
  plus mutate/conflict/status behavior
- Simulator or device-backed acceptance coverage for iOS
- A repeatable TestFlight or equivalent Apple distribution lane
- Docs that can point to those validation surfaces directly
