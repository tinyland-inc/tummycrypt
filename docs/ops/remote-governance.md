# Remote Governance

Policy document for how `tcfs` manages its git remotes, branches, and tracker
state across the `origin` / `tinyland` / `yoga` topology.

Anchor: the [Canonical Home](../../README.md#canonical-home) section of `README.md`
declares `Jesssullivan/tummycrypt` as the canonical source repository. This
document makes the consequences of that declaration operational.

## Current Remote Topology

As of 2026-05-09:

| Remote | URL | Branches | `main` ahead of `origin/main` | `main` behind `origin/main` | Role |
|--------|-----|----------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|------|
| `origin` | `https://github.com/Jesssullivan/tummycrypt.git` | 26 | 0 | 0 | canonical source + release authority |
| `tinyland` | `git@github.com:tinyland-inc/tummycrypt.git` | 65 | 21 | 141 | active downstream dev surface |
| `yoga` | `yoga:git/tummycrypt` (bare SSH) | 9 cached remote-tracking branches | 137 | 472 | retired legacy mirror; live fetch timed out on 2026-05-09 |

Divergence points:

- `origin/main` ↔ `tinyland/main`: merge-base is now `796b42e`
  (`origin/main`, 2026-04-17). `tinyland/main` merged `origin/main` via
  tinyland PR #60 on 2026-04-17, but canonical `origin/main` has since moved
  141 commits ahead. The remaining 21 tinyland-only commits are the 19 pre-sync
  historical commits recorded in
  [Tinyland-Unique Commit Disposition](tinyland-upstream-disposition-2026-04-17.md)
  plus the sync merge pair (`6f7841f`, `987a6b4`).
- `origin/main` ↔ `yoga/main`: there is no current merge base in this checkout;
  yoga represents a `v0.9.x`-era tcfs snapshot and is not a current development
  branch. A May 9, 2026 `git fetch yoga --prune` attempt timed out over SSH,
  so current governance decisions should treat the cached `yoga/*` refs as
  historical evidence, not as a live collaboration surface.

## Declared Roles

### `origin` — canonical source and release authority

- All **release tags** (`v0.12.x`) are cut from `origin/main`. No release tag
  is authoritative on any other remote.
- All **planning issues** (roadmap, milestones, sprint goals) live on
  `origin`. Issues filed on `tinyland` or `yoga` are downstream-specific
  (infra, package signing, distribution channels) and must not duplicate
  planning state.
- All **contributor PRs** targeting the canonical product land on `origin`.
  A PR that only exists on `tinyland` is staging-only until a corresponding
  `origin` PR is opened.
- `origin` is the merge gate of record. As of 2026-05-09, GitHub branch
  protection does not enforce required status checks, so operators must verify
  Actions are green before merging until required checks are configured.
  `tinyland` and `yoga` protections do not substitute for `origin`'s.

### `tinyland` — active downstream dev surface

`tinyland-inc/tummycrypt` is not a passive mirror. It carries real feature
work from the `tinyland-inc` org's internal development cadence, often
merged there first and upstreamed to `origin` afterward.

- `tinyland/main` may **lead** `origin/main` by a small number of commits
  (integration drift). A lead of **greater than 20 commits** is a
  governance smell and should open a tracker issue for reconciliation.
  That threshold is currently exceeded; see #312 and the disposition doc.
- `tinyland/main` must **not fall behind** `origin/main` indefinitely.
  Reconcile at release-cut cadence **or** weekly, whichever is more frequent.
- Reconciliation is done **into `origin` first**, then `origin → tinyland`
  via a sync. Never the reverse (never force-push `tinyland` onto `origin`).
- `tinyland`-specific infrastructure (binary-signing identifiers such as
  `io.tinyland.tcfsd`, binary cache host `nix-cache.tinyland.dev`)
  is legitimate downstream coupling, but it is **externalization-sensitive**:
  see [v0.12.2 evidence matrix §Blocker A](../release/v0.12.2-evidence-matrix.md#blocker-a--nix-cache-externality)
  for the cache-reachability implication. The concrete #307 tracker is closed;
  future Nix proof belongs in the per-tag distribution smoke evidence.

### `yoga` — retired legacy mirror

`yoga` is a bare SSH remote on a laptop host. It carries a `v0.9.x`-era
snapshot that predates the current `v0.12.x` line by 472 commits in the current
cached remote comparison.

- `yoga` is **not pushed to** from this point forward.
- Cached `yoga/*` remote-tracking refs, including `yoga/main`, remain as
  **read-only historical reference** only.
- When the host is decommissioned the remote can be dropped with
  `git remote remove yoga` without information loss, provided anything
  worth preserving has been audited first.
- Any attempt to land new work on `yoga` should be redirected to a PR on
  `origin`.

Current formal decision for #313: **documentation-only retirement**. No archive,
host deletion, key revocation, or local remote removal is part of the current
proof/branch-hygiene lane. Revisit archive-or-remove only when an operator
names a live host access window and an archive destination.

## Branch Lifecycle Rules

These rules apply to `origin`. `tinyland` has its own branch tranche (65 at
time of writing) which is triaged separately and tracked under the
[tinyland branch triage issue](#related-trackers).

- **Feature branches** land via squash-merge to `main` and are deleted
  promptly after merge. Both the local and remote branch delete steps are
  expected; `gh pr merge --auto --squash --delete-branch` is the canonical
  incantation.
- **Release branches** are not used today; releases are cut from tags on
  `main` directly.
- **Long-lived codex branches** (`codex/*` originating from Codex agent
  runs) are permitted during active work but must be closed or merged
  within the week they were opened. Stale codex branches past 14 days
  should be audited for supersession.
- **No force-push to `main`** on any remote. Force-push on feature branches
  is acceptable only by the branch author and only before review is
  requested.

## Sync Policy

### `origin → tinyland/main`

Preferred path: open a PR on `tinyland` whose base is `tinyland/main` and
whose head is a branch tracking `origin/main`. Merge to land the `origin`
history on `tinyland/main`. Conflicts get resolved in the sync PR, not in
a separate commit against `main`.

Mechanical equivalent:

```bash
git fetch origin main
git fetch tinyland main
git checkout -b sync/origin-$(date +%Y-%m-%d) tinyland/main
git merge --no-ff origin/main
git push tinyland sync/origin-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
# open PR against tinyland/main
```

### `tinyland → origin`

Do not fast-forward `origin/main` to `tinyland/main`. Instead:

1. For each tinyland-unique commit that is a real upstream candidate,
   open an `origin` PR.
2. For each tinyland-unique commit that is downstream-specific (infra,
   org-specific wiring), leave it on tinyland and annotate in a
   persistent downstream-only list.
3. Squash-merge `origin` PRs normally. After all upstream candidates are
   landed, `tinyland/main` can resync via the `origin → tinyland` path.

### yoga

No sync policy. `yoga` is archived.

## Tracker State Policy

- **Planning issues**, **roadmap issues**, and **release-surface issues**
  live on `origin` only.
- **Downstream-specific issues** (binary signing, package channels,
  infrastructure externalization) may live on `tinyland` if they concern
  the `tinyland-inc` substrate and cannot be acted on via `origin`.
  Otherwise they belong on `origin`.
- **Bulk Codex migration issues** on tinyland should be closed in batches
  once their upstream `origin` equivalents are identified; see
  [related trackers](#related-trackers).

## Related Trackers

Execution work derived from this policy is tracked as separate issues so
the governance document itself stays a policy statement and not a punch
list:

- **Disposition of tinyland-unique history**: #311 is closed. The 19
  pre-sync tinyland-only commits were audited in
  [Tinyland-Unique Commit Disposition](tinyland-upstream-disposition-2026-04-17.md)
  and all were classified as superseded or bookkeeping; zero upstream
  cherry-picks are required. The 2026-04-17 audited 21-commit lead on
  `tinyland/main` was therefore 19 historical commits plus the 2 sync-merge
  commits from the 2026-04-17 origin→tinyland resync.

- **Triage the tinyland branch tranche**: 65 branches after two prune
  tranches removed 7 superseded feature branches. The remaining live mix is
  `41` `fix/*`, `14` `feat/*`, `4` `test/*`, `3` `chore/*`, `1`
  `refactor/*`, `1` `homebrew-tap`, and `1` `main`. The tracker issue now
  has a concrete non-destructive prune proposal:
  [Tinyland Branch Prune Proposal - 2026-05-09](tinyland-branch-prune-proposal-2026-05-09.md).
  As of May 9, 2026, no remote branches were deleted during the TCFS parity
  proof push; the next action should be an explicit operator-approved prune
  tranche, not opportunistic cleanup.

- **Retire `yoga` formally**: the remote is already de facto retired.
  Current decision is documentation-only retirement: leave the cached refs and
  local remote in place for historical lookups, perform no sync activity, and
  defer archive/removal until there is an explicit host-access window.

- **Nix cache externalization**: #307 is closed. The
  legacy `nix-cache.fuzzy-dev.tinyland.dev` externality remains useful context.
  Current flake and CI config point at `nix-cache.tinyland.dev`; future release
  truth should be captured in per-tag distribution smoke evidence rather than
  reopening the old tracker.

## Revision History

- 2026-04-17 — Initial governance doc. Captures the 3-remote topology at
  its current divergence state and declares roles + sync policy.
- 2026-04-17 — Refreshed after tinyland PR #60 merged `origin/main` into
  `tinyland/main` and #311 closed with zero upstream cherry-picks required.
- 2026-04-29 — Refreshed branch counts and divergence after origin PRs #337
  through #340 landed; tinyland now trails canonical `origin/main` again while
  keeping the same 21-commit downstream lead.
- 2026-05-08 — Branch hygiene was inspected during the usage-reality push but
  intentionally deferred. `origin/main` is current, several local branches track
  deleted remotes, and product proof is still actively moving through the next
  FileProvider/conflict and distribution packets. Do not prune or delete
  branches as part of this sprint until the next proof packet is chosen.
- 2026-05-09 — Refreshed remote counts after parity proof PRs #341 and #342
  merged. `origin/main` is current and all #342 checks passed. `tinyland` still
  has the 65-branch tranche; `yoga` live fetch timed out and remains retired.
  Branch deletion remains a separate explicit-approval action.
- 2026-05-09 — Refreshed divergence after proof and release-claim PRs #343
  through #348 merged. `tinyland` remains 65 branches with the same 21-commit
  downstream lead and a 138-commit lag behind `origin/main`; cached `yoga/main`
  remains 137 commits ahead and is now 469 commits behind current `origin/main`.
- 2026-05-09 — Refreshed divergence after PR #350 merged. `tinyland` remains
  65 branches with the same 21-commit downstream lead and a 140-commit lag
  behind `origin/main`; cached `yoga/main` remains 137 commits ahead and is now
  471 commits behind current `origin/main`. #313 is treated as
  documentation-only retirement unless an operator later approves archive or
  removal.
- 2026-05-09 — Added a non-destructive tinyland branch prune proposal. The
  proposal recommends 44 fix/chore branches for an operator-approved first
  deletion tranche, 17 feature/test branches for short human review before
  deletion, and keeps `main`, `homebrew-tap`, `feat/fuse-free-vfs-nfs`, and
  `refactor/retire-fuse-crates`.
- 2026-05-09 — Refreshed divergence after PR #351 merged as `26e9fab3e08d`.
  `tinyland/main` remains 21 commits ahead and is now 141 commits behind
  `origin/main`; cached `yoga/main` remains 137 commits ahead and is now 472
  commits behind `origin/main`. The `origin` branch count remains 26 after
  pruning the deleted PR branch.
